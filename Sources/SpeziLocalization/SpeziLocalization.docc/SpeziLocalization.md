# ``SpeziLocalization``

Work with localized resources.


## Overview

The SpeziLocalization target implements localization-related facilities, for working with localized string and file resources.

It defines extensions on `Bundle` and `LocalizedStringResource` to enable applications to work with multiple/dynamic localizations at runtime, and implements a `LocalizedStringResource`-inspired ``LocalizedFileResource`` type for working with file-based localization.
