/// How a `Locale` should be matched against a ``LocalizationKey``.

/// - ``requirePerfectMatch``
/// - ``preferLanguageMatch``
/// - ``preferRegionMatch``
/// - ``custom(_:)``
public enum LocaleMatchingBehaviour: Sendable {
    /// Only perfect matches are allowed
    ///
    /// If no perfect match exists, but there does exist a match where e.g. the resource's language matches but its region doesn't, it will still get ignored.

    ///     The closure should return a score in the range `0...1`; any values exceeding that range will get clamped.
