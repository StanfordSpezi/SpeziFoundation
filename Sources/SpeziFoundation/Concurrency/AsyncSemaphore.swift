/// Asynchronous semaphore for coordinating the concurrent execution of tasks.
///
/// ``AsyncSemaphore`` provides a mechanism to regulate access to a resource that allows multiple accesses up to a certain limit.
/// Beyond this limit, tasks must wait until the semaphore signals that access is available. It supports both cancellable and non-cancellable waits,
/// enabling tasks to either proceed when the semaphore is available or throw a `CancellationError` if the task was cancelled while waiting.
///
/// - Note: This semaphore uses Foundation's `NSLock` for thread safety and handles task suspension and resumption internally.
///
/// ### Usage
///
/// Initialize ``AsyncSemaphore`` with the maximum number of concurrent accesses allowed:
/// ```
/// let semaphore = AsyncSemaphore(value: 3)
/// ```
///
/// To wait for access (blocking the task until access is available):
/// ```
/// await semaphore.wait()
/// ```
///
/// To wait for access but track cancellations (leading to the throwing of a `CancellationError`):
/// ```
/// try await semaphore.waitCheckingCancellation()
/// ```
///
/// To signal that a task has completed its access, potentially allowing waiting tasks to proceed:
/// ```
/// semaphore.signal()
/// ```
///
/// To signal all waiting tasks to proceed:
/// ```
/// semaphore.signalAll()
/// ```
///
/// To cancel all waiting tasks (only those that support cancellation):
/// ```
/// semaphore.cancelAll()
/// ```
///
/// - Warning: `cancelAll` will trigger a runtime error if it attempts to cancel tasks that are not cancellable.
