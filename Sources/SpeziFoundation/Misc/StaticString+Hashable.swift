// SAFETY: We're declaring a retroactive conformance here, i.e. we are extending a type we don't own by making it conform to a protocol we don't own.
// This is fine, in this specific case, since `StaticString` is a frozen type, meaning that we can safely assume that its layout and public properties
// won't change. Furthermore, in this specific case there really is only one sensible way of implementing this.
// Should this ever get added to the Standard Library, we should remove this conformance.
