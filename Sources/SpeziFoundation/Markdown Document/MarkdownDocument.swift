/// A Markdown document.
///
/// The ``MarkdownDocument`` struct is a lightweight data type representing a (potentially pre-processed) Markdown document,
/// consisting of optional metadata, and contents which are represented as a series of ``Block``s.
///
/// ### Metadata
///
/// When using any of the `processing:` initializers to create a ``MarkdownDocument`` (e.g.: ``init(processing:customElementNames:)-(String,_)``),
/// any frontmatter-style metadata entries at the very beginning of the input will be parsed into a ``Metadata-swift.struct`` object.
///
/// The frontmatter-style metadata takes the following format:
/// ```
/// ---
/// key1: value1
/// key2: value2
/// ---
/// ```
/// I.e., the metadata is a simple String-based key-value mapping, with one entry per line, that is enclosed within two `---` lines.
///
/// - Tip: If you just want to extract the metadata from a Markdown file and don't care about the rest of the document, you can use ``Metadata-swift.struct/init(parsing:)``.
///
/// ### Content Blocks
///
/// The ``blocks`` property stores the Markdown document's content, split up into a series of ``Block``s.
/// A block is either a section of Markdown-formatted text (``Block/markdown(id:rawContents:)``, or an extracted ``CustomElement`` (``Block/customElement(_:)``).
///
/// > Important: The ``MarkdownDocument`` does not perform any Markdown _parsing_;
///     it only performs _processing_ of the Markdown input, in the sense that it splits up the input text into a series of sections of Markdown text, and parses any custom tags that may be contained in the Markdown.
///
/// For example, creating a ``MarkdownDocument`` from the following Markdown input (which ostensibly consists of two "parts": a markdown part with two sections, and a custom element part with a single signature field):
/// ```markdown
/// # Study Consent Form
/// Welcome to our study. As part of your participation, you will need to fill out and sign this consent form.
///
/// ## Your rights
/// You have the right to revoke this consent at any time; if you wish to do so, contact us at studies@acme.org
///
/// <signature id=sig />
/// ```
/// would result in a ``MarkdownDocument`` consisting of a total of three blocks: two markdown blocks (one per section) and one custom element block for the signature.
///
/// ``Block``s can have an ``Block/id``, which is determined based on the block's contents:
/// - for markdown blocks, the block will have an `id` if the block's markdown text starts with a heading, in which case the `id` will be derived from the heading's text;
/// - for custom element components, the block's `id` will derived from the element's `id` attribute, if present.
///
/// ### Custom Elements
///
/// The ``MarkdownDocument`` supports the handling of custom elements embedded within the Markdown input.
/// This behaviour is opt-in, on a per-element-name basis: the parser will only process custom elements whose name
/// matches one of the `customElementNames` passed to the ``MarkdownDocument`` initializer.
/// Any eligible custom elements are parsed into ``Block/customElement(_:)`` blocks;
/// ineligible elements (i.e., those with names not listed in `customElementNames`) are treated as if they were normal Markdown text,
/// allowing a downstream Markdown parser to handle them instead.
///
/// Custom elements (which are in the parsing result represented by the ``CustomElement`` type) are written using a simple HTML-style syntax, consisting of the following components:
/// - name: the name of the HTML tag
/// - attributes: a list of string-based key-value pairs
/// - content: a list of ``CustomElement/Content-swift.enum`` values,
///     each of which is either raw text (which itself could possibly be markdown), or another, nested ``CustomElement``.
///
/// Some examples:
/// ```html
/// <toggle id=toggle-1 initial-value=false>
///     Do you agree to the terms stated above?
/// </toggle>
///
/// <select id=s1>
///     What's your preference for a nice vacation?
///     <option id=o1>Mountains</>
///     <option id=o2>Beach</option>
/// </select>
///
/// <signature id=s1 />
/// ```
///
/// The parser, while not being a fully fledged HTML parser, can handle parsing of the elements like shown above,
/// and also comments and some syntactic sugar like omitting the name in the closing tag (e.g., `</>`),
/// self-closing tags (e.g., `<signature />`), and omitting explicit quotes (`"`) for attribute values that are also valid identifiers
/// (eg: `id=consent-sig` instead of `id="consent-sig`; both of these will result in the same attribute value.
///
